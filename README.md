# Genetic Programming in Clojure for Symbolic Regression

Coursework from 2017.

Note: This method does not work well for complex datasets. Over time, it produces a garbled mess of functions that grows too large/complex for the program to continue running on most machines.

This [online viewer](http://viewer.gorilla-repl.org/view.html?source=github&user=JonaLaw&repo=CS-0254-Final&path=simple_symbolic_regression.clj) shows the code in its intended format.

This [runnable online version](https://repl.it/JUMz/4) allows for a glance at the code's different outputs.
